# deliveryDriver

This is my first personal project to get started with Unity. The main task is to deliver the packages (with the blue logo) to Elon Musk! You can speed up by driving through the orange box on the road, but colliding with any other objects will slow you down. Note that this is currently running on desktop browser only.

Happy delivering!
