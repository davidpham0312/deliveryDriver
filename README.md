# deliveryDriver

This is my first personal project to get started with Unity. The main task is to deliver the packages (with the blue logo) to Elon Musk! You can control the car by using the arrow button on your keyboard. During the game, you can speed up by driving through the orange box on the road, but colliding with any other objects will slow you down. 

You can access the game through the link: https://pdanh0312.itch.io/delivery-driver

Happy delivering!
